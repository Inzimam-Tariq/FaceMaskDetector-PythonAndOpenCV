## How to build on your system
1. Clone the repo or Download and extract
2. Open project in any code editor (you can also open the cmd in the folder where you clone or extract code)
3. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" command without qoute (it will install all the dependencies)
4. Open train_mask_detector.py file and change the path of dataset i.e. on my system its "D:\Web\FaceMaskDetector-PythonAndOpenCV\dataset"
5. If everything goes normal you can proceed to step 7
6. OpenCV may not be istalled properly if so, download and istall OpenCv
[Here is a good documentation](https://pysource.com/2019/03/15/how-to-install-python-3-and-opencv-4-on-windows)
7. run "python train_mask_detector.py" to train your model. (It will take quite a long time.)
8. run the "detect_mask_video.py" to open camera and see the app working. (It will take quite a long time.)

Thats it :smile:.
